                    <p>Hope For Change was founded in 2000 as the Juvenile Justice Fund, an independent nonprofit organization with a focus on providing real solutions for vulnerable children and families affected by courts.</p>
                    <p>Over time, we've expanded our work to include policy advocacy and research, to lead change in the community. We also provide comprehensive wrap-around services to address trauma and vulnerabilities for girls, boys, and LGBTQ youth in our Center.</p>
                    <p>Today, we serve 150+ youth annually, ages 12 and over, with complex cases and needs each year with one mission in mind: to spark a bright future.</p>
