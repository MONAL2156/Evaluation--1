        <div class="Small_container">Our organization is black led and we focus deeply on hiring from our community and more specifically our base, we do this as we need to grow our movement to scale and we believe deeply that those who operate in our spaces should understand the dynamics of what our communities are experiencing on the day to day. Our organization is made up of black immigrants, black women, and folks who are affected by the carceral system both directly and indirectly this means we have a staff that see's our base as not just numbers but as folks who are experiencing the same things they have and may continue to regardless of their occupation
